# ascii_renderer
a script to turn JPEG PNG and JFIF images into ascii .txt files

the dimensions of the image are always h = 100 by w = 200 ascii characters because of the way notepad spacing works 
its ok to change the dimensions in the im_to_ascii function but keep the aspect ratio at 2:1 w:h this is explained in the code itself aswell
